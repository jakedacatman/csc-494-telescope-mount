# CSC-494 Telescope Mount Conversion - Individual Project

## Project Description

  This project repository contains the software component of a tracking/go-to conversion of a Celestron CG-3 equatorial telescope mount.
  
  Telescopes have become more affordable over time, but telescopes that can automatically track objects across the sky and/or point to specific objects in the sky are still a bit expensive. Even conversion kits for manually operated telescopes are not cheap. This tracking is indispensable for any kind of photography or scientific work, as the telescope needs an object in the same spot within its field of view for an extended period of time in order to collect any meaningful results. 
  
  This project seeks to create such a conversion kit for the telescope that I own, which uses a Celestron CG-3 mount.

  An equatorial mount has two axes that can be manipulated: right ascension (left-right) and declination (up-down). To track an object across the sky, only the right ascension needs to be changed. To "go-to," or find, an object in the sky, however, both axes needs to be moved. 

## Requirements
- Create control software for the two required motors (right ascension and declination axes)
- Integrate user input (buttons and a display)
